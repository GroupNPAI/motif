explanation:

The motif application (dengueNetMotifCMD) was compiled to be used in the Windows operating system. It is an application created in the C language. This application requires some parameters to be used. Such how:


name: Name of the input file, and in this case the one used was "EntradaMotifCOVIDBA17052021_145mun-Semana.txt";

thereshold: It is a model parameter and can be understood from the Supplementary Information.pdf and the article https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.07.018;

window: It is a parameter of the model and can be understood from the Supplementary Information.pdf and the article https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.07.018;

lag: It is a parameter of the model and can be understood from the Supplementary Information.pdf and the article https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.07.018;

tau: It is a parameter of the model and can be understood from the Supplementary Information.pdf and the article https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.07.018;

start_day: Parameter that indicates the starting day/week of the data sequence;
final_day: Parameter that indicates the final day/week of the data sequence;
